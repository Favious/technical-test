# Technical test solution

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project created as a solution to the [Frontend test](https://github.com/luuna-tech/test/tree/master/frontend) created by [`Luuna's Tech Team`](https://github.com/luuna-tech/)

## Demo ðŸš€

You can try the live demo on the next link -> https://technical-test-faviop.vercel.app/

## Design ðŸ’­

The first step to delivering a solution is the design, I created mockups in Figma based on the best UI/UX trends for doing the layups.

You can check out [the public Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/sWKaKIk4XsMLG5EpzAolwT/Technical-Test-Favio-Pariente?node-id=1%3A6&t=b9ZiC5Xrdgw6xwTy-0) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Process ðŸ”§

As part of the development process I wanted an easy way to organize the features that I needed to build so I choosed the GitHub Projects platform in order to have tickets I use while developing the app.
